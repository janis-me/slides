Hey! Great to have you here.

# What is slidev

Guess what, You're looking at it already. ðŸ˜®

<div class="abs-tr mx-10 m-4 text-xl">
  <img src="./slidev-logo.png" style="height: 200px" />
</div>

<v-clicks>

- Initiated by Anthony Fu
- "Presentation Slides for Developers"

</v-clicks>

<div class="inline-flex gap-5">
  <v-click>
    <img src="./brendan-eich.png" style="height: 200px" />
  </v-click>
  <v-click>
    <img src="./powerpoint.png" style="height: 200px" />
  </v-click>
</div>

<!--
So, what is slidev?

Slidev was initiated by Anthony Fu, who you probably know from countless web-dev related things like Vue, Vite, Vitest, Nuxt, UnoCSS, node-modules.dev.. this dude is a literal machine.

It describes itself simply as `Presentation slides for developers`. I would describe it as the perfect superhuman hybrid of Brandon Eich and Microsoft PowerPoint.

<fa7-solid-ban v-click class="absolute left-95 bottom-43" text-9xl />

<!--
Comparing it to powerpoint is wrong in many ways though, because it is not a WYSIWYG editor, but instead based on simple markdown, with many extensions and some modifications though, we'll get to that.
